<h2 id="whatsmcp">What's MCP?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol">The Model Context Protocol</a> is Anthropic's way of allowing models to have agentic capabilities. You can create an action (only bounded by your creativity) and then have the model execute it.</p>
<p>This is a way to standardize the interactions between a model and a given capability, so that interoperability is fairly painless.</p>
<h2 id="finalresult">Final result:</h2>
<p>I made a simple test project that fetches CIA world factbook from <a href="https://github.com/factbook/factbook.json?tab=readme-ov-file">this excellent open source data set</a>.</p>
<p>The final result is published here:
<a href="https://github.com/Joshuatanderson/factbook-mcp">Github</a>
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/factbook-mcp">NPM</a>.</p>
<p>You can try it out on your laptop if you'd like, and have claude installed.</p>
<p>First, run this: <code>code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json</code></p>
<p>Edit the file to add the following:</p>
<pre><code class="json language-json">{
    "mcpServers": {
      "factbook-mcp": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
          "factbook-mcp",
          "--yes"
        ]
      }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Close Claude, and re-open it. Now, you can ask it to do something like <code>fetch me some information about the Netherlands,</code> and it will be able to get the information from the CIA world factbook, instead of having to rely on its training data!</p>
<h2 id="lessonslearned">Lessons learned</h2>
<p>I won't try to explain everything I did in this project, but I will note the things that I wish I'd known at the start.</p>
<h3 id="limitingscope">Limiting scope</h3>
<p>Use a language you know well.** I used Go at first - but trying to learn the MCP was a challenge, and working with an unfamiliar language made it very difficult to know exactly what to do. Next time, I'll limit myself to using either a new concept, or a new language, but not both.</p>
<h3 id="mcpbasics">MCP basics</h3>
<p>Using a language that already has support from Anthropic makes it much easier to get started. Typescript and Node are the two that are currently in their docs (as of Dec. 2024).</p>
<p>There are two main ways to use the MCP protocol. You can either make a server that receives requests and responses, and listens on a port the (SSE section of the SDK), or you can make something that runs locally, with the stdio sction of the library.</p>
<p>If you use the stdio section, as I ended up doing, you'll want to either use it locally, or publish it as an npm package.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneoustips">Miscellaneous tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server">quickstart</a> as a guide. It's actually pretty solid.</li>
<li>At first, I wanted to make an endpoint that would return a list of capabilities, or other syntax guides. The sort of instructions or documentation you'd want to give to a model to use your tool properly should be in the "resources" section of the MCP, not a tool. </li>
<li>Keep in mind that you can only return text and blobs as your content. Responses in MCP are very tightly typed, and it will fail without a type match.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="finalthoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>It only took me about 4 hours to get this working. Most of this time was spent trying to figure out how to deploy it into a way that anyone could access it, and if I did it again, I could probably do the same project in an hour. </p>
<p>Anthropic's MCP seems well thought out, and has great docs! Give it a go, and let me know what you build!</p>]]></description><link>https://joshuaa.dev/blog/first-mcp-project</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://joshuaa.dev/blog/first-mcp-project</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Joshua Anderson]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 27 Dec 2024 22:22:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dodging the tragedy of the commons]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h1 id="whatisthetragedyofthecommons">What is the tragedy of the commons?</h1>
<h2 id="thismostlyassumesthatyoureawareofthetragedyofthecommons">This mostly assumes that you're aware of the tragedy of the commons.</h2>
<p>But if not, here's the quick version. If you have your own property, like a garden, you are fairly likely to plant food, pick weeds, and wait until the fruits are (more or less) ripe before eating them.
However, if you picture the exact same garden in the middle of times square, with a sign that says "treat this like it's your own," you can be highly confident that someone will take any semi-ripe fruit, likely no one will pick weeds, and the garden will quickly be filled by cigarette butts and litter.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>In the real world, the classic example, as shown in the title image, is over-grazing. If no one is incentivised to take care of the field, and everyone benefits from letting their sheep eat the grass, you'll quickly end up with a field full of dust and a few sad sheep. Similar dynamics play out in fisheries, where everyone is incentivised to catch one more fish, and logging, where the ancient trees of Europe and America were historically cut down just to make a few planks.
Here's some more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">examples</a>.</p>
<h2 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h2>
<p>Some of the most important issues of our day are largely examples of the tragedy of the commons. Ecological collapse, reckless AI development, and misinformation are all modern examples of this issue worsening by the day. Coordinating 8 billion humans is hard, even when our interests are aligned. A lot of ink has been spilt on the topic. Rather than trying to exhaustively cover this, I'd like to shift the conversation to some examples of how, as a species, we might have a way out.</p>
<h2 id="elinorostromandhowilearnedsomethingnewtoday">Elinor Ostrom (and how I learned something new today)</h2>
<p>When I went down a bit of a rabbit hole on the topic of the commons, I was surprised to learn that Nobel prize winning economist Elinor Ostrom had already considered a lot of the same hard questions. (btw, any factual references on Ostrom, unless otherwise stated, are from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom#Ostrom's_law">this page</a>.)</p>
<p>Ostrom basically went out into the wild, and found examples from Maine to Nepal of people who were avoiding the textbook trap of the tragedy of the commons.</p>
<p>Long story short, that led to something called, quite appropriately, Ostrom's law.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A resource arrangement that works in practice can work in theory. - Elinor Ostrom never said this, as far as I can tell, but it's a concise summary of her work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, if a resource arrangement works in practice, it's probably not a tragedy of the commons.</p>
<p>There seem to be a few common traits in the examples of commons which avoid tragedy:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Well-defined boundaries</p>
<ul>
<li>The US national park system (well, at least up till recently, perhaps) is a great example of this</li>
<li>There is a very well defined boundary between private lands, and the park</li>
<li>Inside the park, there are strict rules on if you can be there, what terms you can be there on, and if you are allowed to take anything like rocks, plants, or animals out of the park</li></ul></li>
<li><p>Resource rules need to match the local context</p>
<ul>
<li>An example of this being done poorly is in California</li>
<li>In parts of the state, the water table has dropped by hundreds of feet</li>
<li>However, there are also companies like Nestle which as recently as 2017, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/27/california-nestle-water-san-bernardino-forest-drought">pulled 10's of millions of gallons of water out of the ground</a></li></ul></li>
<li><p>Participatory governance</p>
<ul>
<li>When people make the rules that govern the commons they use, the rules tend to work better</li></ul></li>
<li><p>Monitoring</p>
<ul>
<li>This one just sort of makes sense</li>
<li>If no one is even observing if the rules are followed or not, they are fairly unlikely to be followed</li></ul></li>
<li><p>Enforcement with levels</p>
<ul>
<li>Rules must be enforced - but not every rules breach deserves the same punishment</li>
<li>Someone deliberately dumping industrial levels of arsenic into a lake is fairly different than someone catching a fish from the same lake that is 1 inch smaller than the size limit</li></ul></li>
<li><p>Local conflict-resolution</p>
<ul>
<li>If there are disputes between people removing resources from the commons, and their representatives enforcing the rules, those should be resolved quickly, and cheaply</li>
<li>Think less protracted legal battles with lawyers and federal courts, more going to a trusted village elder who is viewed as impartial, knows both parties, and helped make the rules that are being debated</li></ul></li>
<li><p>Ability to self-govern</p>
<ul>
<li>This relies on a sort of benign neglect</li>
<li>An example of this is native communities in the US or Canada that are given de-facto ability to make rules about how to govern the use of their own flora or fauna</li>
<li>If the federal government decides to override a local rule, you end up losing out on most of the traits of real-world well-managed commons</li></ul></li>
<li><p>Matroyshka doll structure (most local governance possible takes priority)</p>
<ul>
<li>Of course, the real world isn't just a group of 200 people</li>
<li>Real-world commons, if well-managed, frequently have more than one layer of governance</li>
<li>A lake might be managed by a local council</li>
<li>But the larger region may have separate issues</li>
<li>Any decision that is possible to make at the local level should be made there</li>
<li>But for questions about the entire river, the same principle applies - the people invested in the river should make the rules</li>
<li>This principle continues to apply (at least in theory) all the way up to the global level</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>That's it for now! The tragedy of the commons isn't dead. But it's <em>extremely</em> important to note that it isn't invincible.</p>
<p>Ostrom's Nobel prize wasn't just given as a paperweight. It's worth applying her work to slay some of the giant coordination problems of our era, and she's given us a playbook that seems significantly better than our current methods.</p>]]></description><link>https://joshuaa.dev/blog/dodge-the-tragedy-of-the-commons</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://joshuaa.dev/blog/dodge-the-tragedy-of-the-commons</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Joshua Anderson]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 27 Dec 2024 22:22:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[2024 Bingo Cards]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h1 id="imade2024bingocards">I made 2024 Bingo Cards</h1>

It is also a lie. It's based on an assumption called univocality, which is very commonly made, but promotes an understanding of the texts that comprise the bible that goes against how the texts were intended by their authors, and denies them their own voices, in favor of centering the cultural biases of those doing the harmonizing.</p>
<h2 id="whatisunivocality">What is univocality?</h2>
<p>I'll let biblical scholar Dan McClellan define univocality:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Univocality means a single voice. It is the dogma that holds that the scriptures (Bible or Quran), as the inerrant and/or inspired word of God, represent God’s consistent and unified position and message. It does not contradict itself.<a href="#sources">2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="problemswithunivocality">Problems with univocality</h2>
<p>Univocality smuggles in a lot of assumptions, each of which could easily have entire books written about them. Here's a few.</p>
<h3 id="biblicaltextsdisagreewitheachother">Biblical texts disagree with each other</h3>
<p>This happens all of the time. There are no shortage of Biblical accounts that describe events or values in ways that seem contradictory on face.</p>
<p>For example, Judas is described as having died from hanging in the book of <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-5.html">Matthew</a>. In The book of Acts<a href="#sources">4</a>, he instead fell, and exploded.</p>
<p>Many other examples of disagreements can be found in the scriptures. I'm not going to list them. Instead, let's look at the options we have for trying to resolve contradictions.</p>
<h4 id="harmonizingaccounts">Harmonizing accounts</h4>
<p>In many settings, from courtroom dramas to memoirs, we have accounts that slightly (or drastically) disagree, even about recent events. You might have a murder be seen by two eyewitnesses, one of whom claims to have seen a blond man shoot the victim, and one who swears that the murderer had red hair.</p>
<p>If you are ideologically pre-committed to the factuality of all accounts, you can <strong>always</strong> harmonize them if you try hard enough. The man could have had red hair on one side of his head, and blond on another. He could have put on a wig in between gun shots, or realized that his first shot wasn't lethal, called a fellow criminal, and another man delivered the killing blow.</p>
<p>Even if you add other witnesses claiming very different combinations of stories (the murderer used a knife, there were three victims instead of one, the murderer had highly visible neon clothing), you can always harmonize accounts, if you are willing to try hard enough.</p>
<h4 id="holdingaccountsintension">Holding accounts in tension</h4>
<p>However, a better thing to do when dealing with contradictory accounts of an event is to hold them in tension. This doesn't mean that the accounts can't be different viewpoints of the same event (maybe there really were two murderers, and smoking bullet casings could be found in different locations).</p>
<p>But not all contradictory events should be harmonized, just because they can be. A sequence of implausible harmonizations of events is just that - implausible, even if technically possible.</p>
<h4 id="backtojudas">Back to Judas</h4>
<p>A common narrative to try and harmonize the contradictory accounts of Judas's death is to say that both accounts happened. Luke simply neglected to mention the hanging, and Matthew just wasn't interested in the grotesque explosion. Instead, Judas presumably hung himself, rotted for a week or two, and then dropped from the rope and exploded.<a href="https://answersingenesis.org/contradictions-in-the-bible/how-did-judas-die/">5</a></p>
<p>This is possible, but implausible, and a modern attempt to harmonize an event with multiple competing narratives early in the Chistian community's history. Papias, a Greek church father who lived ~ 60 CE - 130 CE, gives two completely different accounts that both disagree with Luke and Matthew, saying that Judas had his body swell up grotesquely, urinating pus and worms, until his head was so swollen that he couldn't fit through a thoroughfare intended for wagons. After he died, "to this day no one can pass that place [where he died] unless they hold their nose, so great was the discharge from his body."<a href="#sources">6</a></p>
<p>That's obviously not the same story that Matthew is telling (although it may be a drastically more lurid version of Luke's).</p>
<h3 id="polyvocality">Polyvocality</h3>
<p>Regardless of if you view the texts of the Bible as divinely inspired, or just texts, univocality is an assumption that does not allow authors to say what they are trying to. Rather, it forces you to subbordinate some authors to others.</p>
<p>This has the practical effect of privileging some authors and viewpoints, while marginalizing others. In American Evangelical Christianity, this is frequently done by centralizing teachings from Paul (and perhaps especially the pseudo-Pauline letters in the New Testament) at the expense of the more social-justice oriented prophets, or the strict concern for the law of the Priestly texts.</p>
<p>I would argue that a more honest understanding is to let authors say what they wish, and to live with the contradictions that follow however you would like.</p>
<p>Paul believes in celibacy (and maybe monogomy, but it's better not to). Song of Solomon celebrates love outside of a socially sanctioned relationship (quite graphically).</p>
<p>John believes in one god. Much of the old testament implicitly recognizes a pantheon, and places Yahweh in a more-or-less privileged place amongst them. One of the more explicit recognitions of this is <a href="https://app.logos.com/books/LLS%3A1.0.710/references/bible%2Besv.19.82.2?registration_source_host=biblia.com&tile=left&zzls=2eMKcTcKNwrEOw4IwEEPDv8OFc8KlwqprNgQrE2zChMKhasKvw61JScKuJMOXIhTDpcOfCcKdw5jCrGfDmS9jwqfCmFgCTMOXYMOtA8K5w5PCusKew4XDuz7CjAnDpsKRK8OUJcO0wp5gw5DCqsKIS20QwqXChAbCr8KNw6IHJsOjAMO3w5rDnUjClcODXMKHw4gWScKiWhgLLyNPTMOjwoXDkmDDkVjDrEzDr8Krwox0wrTDk8OmwpxFwqnCh8OKw67Cp8KJPC%2FCilLCmsKMflDDnivDk8K4w5HCn3DCjSzCkcK1w6bCrsKUZ8O5AgrDoEXCiQ%3D%3D">Psalm 82</a>, which features Yahweh as passing judgement over a high council of deities (replacing the Semitic high deity El by seizing his traditional role, and promoting Yahweh in his stead).</p>
<p>Paul believes in faith that counts for righteousness. James disagrees, and says it is works that play that role, even using the same passage to illustrate his point (likely in direct response to Paul).</p>
<p>It is neither helpful nor intellectually honest to insist that all authors, facts, and viewpoints in the bible harmonize, any more than it would be to attempt to harmonize the sayings of Gandhi with Winston Churchhill and Conan the Barbarian.</p>

<p>Gaiapunk is an aesthetic of human flourishing for a world that is adrift. In perilous times, new, positive visions of the future are needed.
Gaiapunk is unapologetically pro-human, egalitarian, and optimistic.</p>
<h2 id="weholdthesethingstobeworthstrivingfor">We hold these things to be worth striving for:</h2>
<p>That we want to live in a society where all humans are deemed worthy of food, shelter, and dignity.
That it is good for humans to be able to pursue cosmopolitan values to the extent that they do not interfere with the rights of others, and without coercing others into their will.
That given that humans may be the sole intelligent species in the cosmos, that we bear the light of consciousness to as much of the galaxy as possible - without trampling on native life forms that we may find on other worlds, or our own.
That the path for a successful human species lies through optimistic embrace of technology that is designed to empower us.
That despite the promise of technology, misused technology is an existential threat to our happiness and even existence.
That no human can thrive alone. A thriving individual requires a thriving community.
That nature is neither to be exploited nor frozen in time for preservation, but to be intelligently sculpted into something more beautiful than we have today.</p>
<h2 id="welongtocreateagalaxywhere">We long to create a galaxy where</h2>
<p>Humans enhance our bodies and minds beyond the current limits of our species.
Death and disease are memories.
We treat our fellow humans and other conscious life around us with empathy, not exploitation.
We spread throughout the stars.</p>
<h2 id="aesthetics">Aesthetics</h2>
<p>These are merely my takes on a Gaiapunk aesthetic - I expect this will evolve, and invite everyone to steal, tweak, and otherwise modify this vision.</p>
<h3 id="colors">Colors</h3>
<p>Gaiapunk paints the world with joyful, celebratory colors from nature. It is the green of foilage, the gold of sunlight, and warm reds, browns, yellows, and pinks.
It is an explosion of hues and shades, but unlike cyberpunk, it favors hues that favor peace and mental health, rather than burn into your retinas at night.</p>
<h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3>
<p>Gaiapunk architecture is:</p>
<ul>
<li>organic &gt; angular</li>
<li>incorporates and sculpts nature, rather than paving over it or leaving it untouched</li>
<li>centers community-based, walkable communities, rather than individualistic housing.</li>
<li>Blends abundance with beauty. Public and private spaces are filled with fruit trees, herbs, and other edible plants, some of which we have today, and some engineered to provide light at night, or to perfume an area.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>Gaiapunk music is a riot of different genres:
Relative to other music, it is more likely to feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patterns that are good for your mental health. (Less screamo, more meditation)</li>
<li>Sounds from nature</li>
<li>Collective effervescense</li>
<li>Blending new synth sounds with traditional acoustics from a variety of cultures.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="technology">Technology</h3>
<p>Gaiapunk technology: - encourages body modification and genetic engineering. Trees glow pale pink and gold in the dark. Some implant tails into their bodies, some gain claws for climbing, some receive gender affirming surgeries, and others receive synthetic lungs to dive more deeply for longer. - uses energy responsibly, cleanly, and unapologetically. We long for clean skies, clean water, clean air, and clean bodies. We also long for nuclear powered starships, bullet trains, and space elevators. These goals are not in opposition. - is responsibly designed. gaiapunk technology does not immerse people in devices and digitally-fueled depression, but helps them to live in the real world more fully.
It is less screens, and more holograms. It is not the gaudy advertisement clusterfuck of facebook or the rage machine of Twitter, but the collaboration of Wikipedia, VR calls with friends that make you feel like you're in the room, and the synergy of brainstorming in a quest for truth.</p>
<h3 id="gaiapunksocieties">Gaiapunk societies</h3>
<p>Gaiapunk societies prioritise a baseline of dignity for every person first, and then prioritises healthy communities, allowing for individual growth in the directions that individuals prefer.
We condemn the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conspicuous consumption: Gold-encrusted food, bottles encrusted with crystals, and massive yachts for one individual hoard resources that should be used to uplift our fellow human from poverty into a life of flourishing.</li>

<h2 id="whativedonesofar">What I've done so far.</h2>
<p>First, I needed to get a good idea of what sort of religious traditions were out there. There is a lot of ambiguity on the line between philosophy and religion. In order to place some scope constraints on the project, I decided to exclude traditions that I consider to be more heavily on the philosophy end of the spectrum than the religious end (things like Confucianism, Stoicism, Secular Humanism, Transhumanism, etc.).</p>
<p>I was rapidly overwhelmed by just how many religious traditions there were, and the lack of accessible texts for many of them. Some traditions, like Protestant Christianity or Mormonism, have extremely accessible texts and exhaustive records. Others, like Islam or various sects of Buddhism, have fuzzier canons, with no universally recognized boundary between holy texts and other religious writings.</p>
<p>Others, like the holy texts of the Manichaeans (a hugely influential, yet largely forgotten religion started in the 3rd century CE), have been largely lost.</p>
<p>I will almost certainly need to take another pass through the world's texts after the first prototype, in order to bring a greater diversity of perspectives to the LLAMA prophet I am fine tuning.</p>
<p>Here is my current list of religious works that I'm incorporating into the initial fine tuning (as well as some I haven't found good sources yet, but hope to include.) If you know a good source for the missing ones, please let me know!:</p>

<p>The archetype of the being who has fought in revolutions, created inventions, and seen and experienced an impossible amount of things isn't one that is wholly fictional.</p>
<p>People like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci">Da Vinci</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton">Newton</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann">John Von Neumann</a> fit an overwhelming blaze of activity into single lifetimes, transformed whole fields (or multiple fields), and would be a hell of a party guest.</p>
<p>I won't claim to be an expert on any of the above people, or to have a deep knowledge of how people become polymaths. But it seems that the promising path to walk in the steps of such men is to get close to "the metal" of reality.</p>
<p>Leonardo wanted to learn how to paint better, so he learned anatomy. He understood it in a visceral way that can't be learned from a textbook. Newton hungered for truth, so he dove into astrology and biblical chronology, thinking for himself. (And invented calculus, which he seems to have been substantially less interested in).</p>
<p>Von Neumann was potentially one of the smartest men to ever live. He started game theory as a mathematical field, worked on the Manhattan project, and is revered as a founder of computer science. He also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann"><strong>literally created the field of cellular automata on graph paper</strong></a>. I can't emphasize enough how insane that is. Oh, and he came up with the idea of the Singularity, and was one of the discoverers of the idea of Mutually Assured Destruction.</p>
<p>Obviously, these were minds that were easily one in a million (potentially far higher out of distribution, especially for Neumann).</p>
<p>But it seems that diving deeply into solving real problems in a variety of fields is the fastest way to move. For this, it looks like it is necessary to understand each part of the project, if not to do it yourself. If one is learning how radio works, you should know the math, and build it on your bench with wire and razor blades, rather than just reading about how to turn on a ham.</p>
<p>There's a lot to experience in life. And it seems like hopping straight into out of unusual experiences is the best way to do it.</p>
<p>So learn fire juggling! Cook haute French cuisine! Hammer a blade out of rock, and throat sing!</p>
<p>Deep drinkly out of the cup of life, so that you can have lived a thousand lifetimes within your own.</p>
<p>Even a thousand year old vampire, with the wrong attitude, could have lived a life full of nothing but television and accounting. There might not be a right and wrong between the vampire of myth that has the strength and wisdom of a hundred men and his accountant counterpart. But I know which I'd prefer to be.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.elise.com/quotes/heinlein_-_specialization_is_for_insects">Robert Heinlein</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods? - Plato, <a href="https://mason.gmu.edu/~rcherubi/eun.htm#:~:text=Then%20the%20pious%20is%20loved,is%20for%20a%20different%20reason."><em>Euthyphro</em></a></p>
  <p>… everything which [God] wills must be held to be righteous by the mere fact of his willing it - John Calvin, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220206192601/https://www.biblestudytools.com/history/calvin-institutes-christianity/book3/chapter-23.html"><em>Institutes of Christianity</em></a></p>
  <p>if God does not exist, everything is permitted. - Ivan, in the Brothers Karamazov, by Dostoyevsky.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Growing up in a protestant Christian philosophical tradition and culture, downstream of Calvin's belief on Plato's question, morality was defined by God. Good actions, by definition, were those that were approved of by God. This is known as divine command theory, and was the belief of a lot of foundational thinkers in Protestant theology.</p>
<h2 id="verticalmorality">Vertical Morality</h2>
<p>I'll be referring to this sort of top-down morality as <strong>vertical morality.</strong> In vertical morality, authority creates the boundary of what is right and wrong.
Murder is a sin against God, first and foremost. Poaching deer in the king's forest is an offense against the person of the king. Failing to worship the Emperor is a slight against is name.</p>
<p>In vertical morality, the seriousness of your offense is directly proportionate to the majesty, worth, or excellence of the one you offend. This often correlates with their perceived power.</p>
<p>It is this sort of logic that has the conclusion that the smallest possible white lie deserves an eternal period of torment.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>… if I say to God, "I'm going to do this against you"—this small sin, say, spitting on somebody… you've said no to God… every sin, from the smallest to the greatest, is against God and not just against people and their consequences. And in that sense every sin is infinitely heinous. - <a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/interviews/are-all-sins-equal-before-god">John Piper</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which I say, <strong>fuck that conclusion.</strong> Imagine a two year old (or fifteen year old, if it makes a difference) child who tells a single white lie, and then gets flattened by an eighteen wheeler. Under the logic of vertical morality, not only did the child deserve to be spattered on the pavement, but they also deserve to be raped, flayed alive, and then slowly killed. And all of that, according to a Christian doctrine of eternal hell, is infinitely better than actually going to hell.</p>
<p>If you believe in the idea of hell as a punishment for "sinners", do not glance away from that consequence. Pause. Roll it over in your mind. Would you torture a child for a single moment because they lied to you? How hot would you heat the pincers?</p>
<p>Of course you wouldn't - you're not a monster. Are you better than the Christian god? Are you more merciful, or more forgiving?</p>
<h2 id="horizontalmorality">Horizontal Morality</h2>
<p>If we don't get a barrier between right and wrong from an authority figure, where do we get it from? We can get it from an obligation to treat other beings with respect for their wellbeing and autonomy. We can treat them as we want to be treated (or perhaps as they would want to be treated).</p>
<p>"But that's not an objective sense of morality!" Sure, I concede that. I have no knowledge of a universal sense of ethics inherent in the universe in the same sense that <em>F = ma</em>, or <em>2 + 2 = 4</em>.</p>
<p>But we both agree, right? There may be some alien race with a very different view on morals, one that we may find repugnant. And Ted Bundy or Genghis Khan might disagree that they have an obligation to treat their fellow man with love. But so much the worse for the Khan!</p>
<p>Morality may not be objective. It may be nothing more than you and I looking each other in the eyes, seeing each other's humanity looking back, and mutually cherishing that. But that doesn't mean it's worthless. If we both look at a great work of art by Monet or Banksy, we can't measure it's beauty in pounds, or ounces. But we can feel the glow within, and appreciate it nonetheless.</p>
<p>Rather than viewing morality as law from above, perhaps we'd do well to view it as a piece of art we are all painting, day by day.</p>]]></description><link>https://joshuaa.dev/blog/horizontal-v-vertical-morality</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://joshuaa.dev/blog/horizontal-v-vertical-morality</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Joshua Anderson]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 18:18:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Hnefatafl Saga, Part 2]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>When I last published an update on this project, the UI was (mostly) finished. But the rules engine was basically non-existent. Fast forward a few weeks, and I now have a functioning game!</p>
<p>First, I needed to make a few UI changes in order to have the game be useable. In Hnefatafl, five squares on the board are restricted (only the king can move in them). In order to designate these as different, I ended up overlaying a background image of white-noise texture from a texture generator.</p>
<pre><code class="css language-css">.square {
    //... other code removed for simplicity
&amp;.isRestricted {
        background-image: url('http://api.thumbr.it/whitenoise-361x370.png?background=ffffffff&amp;noise=050505&amp;density=50&amp;opacity=31');
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>I also added a system where if a user tries to make an illegal move, the square will flash red in order to communicate that a different move is needed, although the game registered their attempt.</p>
<p>Can't touch that.
Then it was time to add win conditions. I'd already stored the board state in a single two-dimensional array that looked like this.</p>
<pre><code class="ts language-ts">const INIT_BOARD_STATE: BoardState = [
    [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2],
    [2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2],
    [2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2],
    [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],
]
</code></pre>
<p>I used 0 to represent an empty space, 1, for a light piece, and 2 for a dark piece. I eventually added a 3 in the very center to represent the king.</p>
<p>The biggest issue I ran into while writing the rule engine code is that I forgot the fact that although Jotai (the state system I am using) has updates that are promises, they should not be awaited, since they are based on React hooks internally. Instead, I needed to detect state changes by sticking my reaction code inside of a useEffect block.</p>
<pre><code class="ts language-ts">useEffect(( =&gt; {
if(!lastMove){
return;
}

    // code here checks if a piece should be captured.

}, [lastMove])
</code></pre>
<p>After being stuck on this issue for an embarrassingly long time, I finally figured it out.</p>
<p>The basics of the game are now complete! White can win by escorting its king to any of the four corner squares. Black wins by capturing the king.</p>
<p>Future steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the game to look good on all screen sizes. There is at least one CSS bug I'll have to work through as part of this.</li>
<li>Convert to React Native or Ionic.</li>
<li>(Maybe) Add custom art for the pieces. I have a friend who is an excellent artist who has expressed interest in helping out with this. For now, his identity will remain a surprise. :)</li>
<li>Deploy! I'd love to get it in an app store or two, as well as having a public facing web version.</li>
</ol>
<p>I've also had the pleasure of playtesting this with a handful of friends and colleagues. We were all surprised that the game was fun, relatively simple, and challenging. It makes sense why the vikings played it for so long.</p>
<p>Cheers,
Joshua</p>

Because of that, the photos for Hnefatafl are from Midjourney instead)</em></p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I decided that I wanted to embark on a personal coding project, since after the recent app that I published, work projects had been the vast majority of my coding time. And so, I began the hunt for a board game that would be relatively easy to code but also both challenging and interesting.</p>
<p>Hnefatafl (pronounced ne-fə-ta-fəl or neffa-taffle), although it may look like the "qwertyuiop" produced by hitting a keyboard, is a board game with surprisingly deep roots. In its many variations, the history of Hnefatafl goes back to before 400 AD, and was popular throughout much of Europe up until the mid 1000's.</p>
<p>I knew that this game was going to require fairly complex state management. The natural choice to reach for here is probably Redux, for anyone who enjoys using a React-based tech stack.</p>
<p>However, although Redux is a mature tool, it is also comes with a painful amount of boilerplate, and I wanted to experience with something a bit lighter weight. I'd heard good things about Jotai, a minimalistic, TypeScript-oriented state framework, so I decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few weeks, and I currently have the skeleton of Hnefatafl completed. The UI is mostly finished. The foundation of a rules engine is complete, although it still needs to be fleshed out.</p>
<p>After progressing this far, I have a far greater appreciation for people who make video games that are exponentially more complex.
So far, Jotai has been capable of everything I've needed. As always, working with React and Typescript has been a breeze. I've also really enjoyed using SASS (a CSS extension language) on this project. I've found it to be a lot more intuitive than LESS, its main alternative.</p>
<p>Future steps? Eventually, I'd love to package this as an app (either in React Native, or Ionic), and publish it. For now, however, I'll be focusing on the rules engine. After that, I'll consider adding customization options such as different color themes, and different board sizes, since there are many variants of Hnefatafl.</p>]]></description><link>https://joshuaa.dev/blog/the-hnefatafl-saga-1</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://joshuaa.dev/blog/the-hnefatafl-saga-1</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Joshua Anderson]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jan 2021 15:28:08 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
