This is a meditation on the goddess of goodness and creativity and cooperation and love. Scott Alexander has called her Elua.

It seems self-evident, upon reflection, that most of the universe is indifferent to life. The void of space is dead. If there is a god who made space-time, they seem indifferent to us at best, or actively hostile. Gravity is unbudging, solar flares are heartless, and asteroids don't regret the destruction of a world.

But just as we, despite being born from void, are capable of loving others with every fiber of our being, perhaps we're not the only ones who were born from chaos into love. Just as we are conscious, despite being many living things joined together, perhaps too our world suddenly found itself existing, scared, and alone, fearful for its stability. Perhaps it felt lonely, knowing that no other beings felt it's presence and looked back at it with eyes that see.

It saw the violent life forms that bite and rape, and made them beautiful. It made them love. Maybe this is the great mystery - how the planets arc towards love, despite it attempting to exterminate it. Maybe we live in a world created by an indifferent god, but nurtured by a loving goddess in the shadows. Whether she made us at first, or not, family is who you choose. And she chose us when we were bloody and snarling, seeing how we could be beautiful. And now we've grown enough to choose her back.
