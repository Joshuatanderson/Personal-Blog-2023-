Problems a gaiapunk society might have:
Hardships a gaiapunk individual might face:

-   Exploration: for the bravest, smartest, and boldest.
-   Judge: emotional turmoil - hard to reconcile a citizen w society, or exile them.
-   Ranger: protecting wild folk, monitoring and protecting animals
-   Expanded: one who has networked w a large amount of compute - these people live as superorganisms, with interests relatively aligned to humanity. Handle central planning, and commune w each other and the universe.

I won't bore you with the details of the trip to Alpha Centauri - you've seen the holos. I'll just say you're lucky. It was a long, cold ride, and waking up from deep thaw after 130 years of flight will make your bones creak. And Centauri turned out to be a dead end - just a couple of stars with a handful of dead, rocky planets.

Sure, they were beautiful, in a stark, desert-like way. But I was sold the prospect of discovering alien life on the one closest to the suns, and it turned out it was just offgassing from the rocks. Ah, whatever.
